2 reviews Â· 4 photos,"Poor service.
Found a new released pair in the store. After trying on my regular size, I felt them large for me so I asked for a smaller one. However, the smaller pair were a little tight... so I asked for the first pair again.
The staff put on a impatient face immediately and turned me down by asking me why I need the first pair again and told me they were big for me.
After my insistence and explanation, she helped me find the first pair and I took it.
She even threw the shoe box down on the cashier desk rudely.
From stepping into the store to my payment was less than 8 minutes time and I talked to the staff politely.
Couldnt find a clue why she was so impatient to me and how I bothered her.
I regret having purchased at that store already and definitely wont go there again.",,Foot Locker,London

We had previously asked a man who worked there if they had Jordan 1s and he just said no . We were looking at a different pair when summer spoke to us , I asked her where I could get Jordan 1s as they had none and she said she was sure there was a pair out the back and would check , as it happened there was , the correct size and colour we were looking for . We were so pleased that we bought them and another pair of Nikes as well . Thankyou footlocker and especially summer !!",,Foot Locker,London

5 reviews,"I would rate this 1 but gave it an extra star purely because of the care 1 worker gave. I think his name was Miguel and he's a manager or something. When I came in he greeted me by asking how I was and to be honest I just nodded as I wasn't too sure if he was talking to me. I then went over to the Air Max 97s and an employee noticed I was looking for someone that worked there. So far so good. He asked me if I needed help and I asked him if he could get me that trainer in my size and he went to check. This is where it all went down hill. Waiting for 5 minutes the guy came back empty handed and another employee who I was waiting by reminded him. So at this stage been waiting 5 mins and the guy who went to look had forgotten. Miguel came over as he's seen Ive been waiting and said what was wrong. I told him his colleague forgot my trainers but hes gone to look for them. Im a very patient person when it comes to these things as I understand it can be busy however, I never received an apology from the worker who had gone to get my trainer or the one who noticed that the first employee had forgotten. Another few minutes later the guy comes back with the wrong pair of trainers and at this point I'm fed up as he goes back to find the right pair. Before he does I tell him to forget it as he didnt apologise then either. I walked off with my mate and Miguel noticed again something was up. I told him his colleagues messed up twice and then I had walked off. I never write reviews but I'm simply writing this for 2 reasons. 1. The 2 employees I faced, suck. The first one never apologised and forgot my trainers then got the wrong one. The second one who noticed, has an issue with giving customers eye contact and didn't apologise either. And 2. If anyone from foot locker sees this, please tell Miguel I appreciated his service and its people like him that will make customers come back to a store and only because of his service will I still shop at that same store... just hope next time he serves me and not the useless colleagues who I had to deal with. Keep up the good work Miguel.",,Foot Locker,London

And who tf would pay Â£3,500 for some aj4 kaws in a UK 6. On StockX the last one sold for 1,580. And no one also buys pandas for more than Â£200. Total scams i wouldnt be suprised if they buy there stuff from StockX and sell it at the store for a 200% profit.

However there are no price tags at the sneaker, you have to ask the staff. Pricy as expected, decide on your own if it is worth for you. After googleing the price for a specific pair on their website it turned out, that the staff told me a wrong higher price. Dodgy.
Dear crew, why don't invest in some price tags? If your prices change very often, electronic tags would do the job. With more transparency, I'm convinced you are getting more thrust from your customers.",15.0,MrSneaker,London

"Local Guide Â· 117 reviews Â· 1,786 photos","Offspring the best sneaker retailer out there hands down. Love this stores vibe. A lot of dope sneakers in stock/ so much variety plus good halve sizes too which is amazing because Im a 8.5-10.5!

Staff are always cool, polite and very patient. They never haggle you or try to up sale, just smiles so you know they are there if you need any help. Some to name Anique, James and the store manager Nadia. Super helpful and very patient. I always leave with a smile like many others.

The new layout of the store is dope! That hatch is very sick! What?! ¦¾¦¾¦¾

Lastly, Offspring have the best raffle system in place, where everyone has a fair chance of winning! Its an amazing community.

Unfortunately the real reason was back then pointing them out that they can't request from people two ID documents to collect shoes while even government doesn't do that.

2 reviews,"Last week I entered an Instagram raffle for the chance to buy a pair of trainers in store. On Saturday, after getting a confirmation email I went in store (Offspring Selfridges) to buy it but was told that they were denying me the right to buy. They informed me to try again later. Today  (Monday) I tried again as it was stated that all pairs that weren't picked up by raffle participants were available for the GP. Out of nowhere all members of staff quickly surrounded me. The manager once again told me (this time aggressively) she is refusing to sell me the trainers. Her abrasive tone made me feel like a peon. After decades of shopping in Selfridges I've never felt so belittled & criminalised as they made me feel in the Selfridges Offspring section. They have truly let down the prestigious Selfridges brand.",2.0,"OFFSPRING London Selfridges, Oxford Street",London

1 review,"Went on 30.09 at 11:20 to buy new pair of Yeezy 350 Bone at Selfridges, the woman with long black hair showed me two pairs, but they were damaged (too many deep folds). I asked her to show me more pairs, but I was told that they only have these 2. That was definitely a lie, because I could see more boxes.

Then a man came, he was really rude to me and told me to leave and that I'm not welcome here. Also he added that they have a ""rule"": I can buy only my size and 1 pair (I wanted a smaller size as a present for my girlfriend).

Just a bunch of lazy kids ""working"" there.

2 reviews Â· 7 photos,"This review isnt for the store but for the trainers. If you are ok with your trainers only having a life span of 2 months ons are the ones for you!!!! Most people prefer them to last longer before they fall apart! Lets just say I have learned my lesson, DONT BUY ONs!!!! I have owned three pairs in my life. The first were water proof trail trainers. They split on both sides of each trainer after five weeks!! I put it down to heavy usage off road. My second pair years later after just one wear in the gym one sole just fell off!!! Needless to say I sent them back and after a month I got a replacement pair!! I thought it was just a faulty pair but the second pair literally fell apart after 2 months of me PTing in a gym. As most people know PTs spend 90% of their time just standing watching their clients training and not actully doing anything them selves. I didnt even wear these trainers outside or run in them on a treadmill!! The soles started to crumble! The coloured part of the sole peeled off! The inside lining on both sides of each shoe split from front to back!! Basically the Quality and Materials used to make these shoes is appalling. When contacting ONs they seemed to think that was ok that 2 months of just standing in them indoors was fine for them to literally fall apart. Basically dont buy shoes from this company!!!

Terrible quality! terrible customer service! all out bad!!!!!!",2.0,On Flagship Store London Regent Street,London

Then the Indian manager came and treated me as if I was stealing from them, in a rude and impolite manner, asking me to pay again, and this is what actually happened, but my problem was with the rude manner of the employees, especially the Indian employee, and even his manager came and kind of hit me.",11.0,On Flagship Store London Regent Street,London

We visited the On Store one Sunday at around 2pm. After a 10 minute queue to get upstairs - the downstairs is used to display the shoe technology and showcase the brand. Once climbing the stairs (lift is available, although if you are unable to walk up stairs it is unlikely you will be dropping >Â£110 on a pair of running shoes) we were led to believe a ten minute wait is ""pretty quick"".

When upstairs we were greeted by a delightful member of staff, Michael. Michael took the time to understand the needs of our three party members and comprehensively walked us through the shoes he recommended for our situations/uses, explaining the different levels of cushioning and the technologies that differed between each shoe. Michael's knowledge and passion for the shoes really shone through, and we were confident with the recommendations he was giving us.

Once we had decided which shoes we wanted to try on, Michael was able to get the right sizes and help us decide on the right shoes for our needs. After trying on 6+ different styles and sizes we found the right shoes for us - eventually settling for the Cloud Monsters.

All in all a great experience and very unexpected to have such attentive and welcoming staff. I have had a pair of Cloud Flows which I have run in for a couple of years and this experience just enhances my positive opinion of the brand. I very much look forward to visiting the store again when new releases come out.",1.0,On Flagship Store London Regent Street,London

There were 4 members of staff having a conversation in the middle of the store not attending to any customers. If the staff would attend to the customers upstairs the queue downstairs would probably go a lot quicker.

The staff also dont have anything identifying them as staff (all wearing different subtly branded On clothing, but no badges / lanyards or anything) so its difficult to work out who is supposed to be helping.

Staff will let you try on shoes and then disappear, which is great if you dont want to buy them or get any information about the shoes.

Trying on shoes is interesting as they have sample shoes to try but you need to take it with a slight pinch of salt as many people has tried them so comfort may be due to the stretching of the shoe due to the sampling - they should sanitise the shoes after each person wore it though.

1 review,"Yesterday I visited the ON store in Regent Street again, due to some technical issue with a pair that I purchased back in April.
I just went to report it and ask what I could do, without any idea or expectations about it.
I was immediately assisted by David K., whom was very thorough in trying to understand the cause of the problem and then opted for a replacement. He also suggested another pair (the new cloudroam waterproof), which was eventually the one I chose.
I then spent some time in the store familiarising with the new shoes and Zanson - who was brilliant as always - carried on assisting me.
I also had the pleasure to meet Steve, who gave me an extensive amount of information and detailed answers to all my questions.
Once again, I left the store with a feeling of gratitude and satisfaction.

I couldn't resist trying the new shoes straight away and I walked for two hours - instead of taking public transports. It was absolutely delightful and almost effortless.

The shop is located in one of the busiest streets in London and hundreds of people visit it every day. It's remarkable to think how those guys go through the day always wearing a positive attitude and making sure that every single person who visits the shop is well looked after.

4 reviews Â· 1 photo,"I am writing to express my disappointment with a recent experience at your store located at 169-173 Regent St., London W1B 4JF, United Kingdom. The incident occurred on (6/26/2023) and involved the store manager, Mr. Sylvester.

The store's official closing time as listed on your website is 8:00 pm. However, to our dismay, when my wife and I arrived at the store at 7:51 pm, we were not permitted entry. The store manager, Mr. Sylvester, had prematurely closed the store and dismissed our pleas for entry, despite our clear distress.

It is important to note that we had an emergency situation on our hands. My wife was suffering from severe foot pain and we urgently needed to purchase a comfortable pair of shoes to alleviate her discomfort. We chose your store because of its excellent reputation for high-quality, comfortable footwear. Unfortunately, Mr. Sylvester showed a complete lack of understanding or compassion for our situation.

Not only did this incident cause unnecessary physical discomfort for my wife, but it also caused us both significant stress. It is disappointing to have such an experience from a store that we have always held in high regard.

I understand that rules are in place for operational efficiency, but this rigid application of the closing time without consideration for customers' circumstances shows a lack of flexibility and customer service. An excellent manager should be able to balance operational needs with exceptional customer service, especially in emergency situations.

I kindly request you to look into this matter and provide necessary training to Mr. Sylvester and his staff, ensuring that this type of incident doesn't occur in the future. I believe that an adjustment in your policy to allow for some flexibility in closing times in emergency situations would be beneficial.

The sales guys are not helping at all, they just stand in the corner somewhere and you have to get them to help you. Then they give you a pair of shoes to try on and they disappear.

I normally dont do reviews but Ive never been so shocked by some staff members.
In the store you have to queue for an elevator to go to the first floor where you can shop. Thats not that big problem but the people managing the elevator were extremely rude to the people waiting and nearly started a fight with a customer who left quickly and wanted to come in again.
Im sure its not in the mind of ON to have such rude staff. Also the people assisting with the shoes were completely useless. My mother wanted to buy some sneakers and after trying them on and getting the right size and all (which took 30 mins alone) the staff member found out that the shoes arent even in stock!

7 reviews,"Honestly one the most inefficient and awful retail experience I've had. And it's quite unacceptable for a brand that charges over Â£100 for running clothing and shoes.

The queue is the main issue in store - you wait for around 30 minutes downstairs in a space, which genuinely is underutilised. You're not building hype, you're building frustration. Once upstairs you're crammed in a small space with a wall of shoes with cabinets that pull in and out, which make it difficult to see the shoes that you'd like to try. What's worse, is that they dont seem to have a lot of shoes/sizes in stock, so that means you can just sit around for 30 minutes waiting to be let in to see the shoe that you want, only for it to not be available in the flagship store. Waste of time.

I've tried ordering online but I haven't had a good experience either, as it arrived late past the promised delivery date and I was not able to receive the package as I was away. Really could be a much better experience, but sadly isn't the case.",3.0,On Flagship Store London Regent Street,London

10 reviews,"I am writing to express my disappointment with a recent experience at your store located at 169-173 Regent St., London W1B 4JF, United Kingdom. The incident occurred on (7/7/2023) and involved the ?store manager, Eugein.

ON shoes run small and I have ordered a pair of shoes and returned through the store on 30/6 (my experience at the time was ridiculous; I had to wait on a long queue for over 25 minutes and finding a member of staff to talk to was hard; they dont wear uniforms and dont have name tags). The size of the store is very tight and crowded making it hard to proper check to find a good pair of shoes. I managed to return my shoes on 30/6 and wasnt able to get a new pair on the store as they have limited options and my size not available (Im size 5 usually but had to size up with ON shoes).
I was encouraged to order online, I ordered the second pair online ( I sized up this time) but when the new pair of shoes came they were also tight and uncomfortable. I made a whole journey again to ON store (regent street) to return my shoes but this right of mine was denied by someone named Eugein ( I think this is his name but not sure as no name tags but he is one of the managers maybe). His excuse for refusing the return is that I wont get my refund back as the system has been broken since 6/6/23 and no customer managed to get their refunds since 6/6/23 ( I returned my shoes on 30/6 and got my refund), I mentioned that but he was adamant that no means no. I was shocked with the lack of care and support from him. He had no right to refuse to return my shoes, I got them 2 days before and never worn!!
It is important to note that I had made a whole journey after work to the store in my very busy schedule, I cant go to Royal Mail to return my shoes as their opening times are (8-10 am) and I work full time so the store is my only option.
I chose your store because of its excellent reputation for high-quality, comfortable footwear. Unfortunately, Eugein showed a complete lack of understanding or compassion for my situation.

This incident cause me unnecessary significant stress and wasted my time (I told Eugein that on the website there was no note to say that I cant return through the store and hence I made this whole journey pointlessly). It is disappointing to have such an experience.

I understand that rules are in place for return and refunds , but Eugein didnt follow without consideration for customers' circumstances shows a lack of flexibility and customer service. An excellent manager should be able to balance operational needs with exceptional customer service.

I look forward to hearing back from you soon regarding this matter. I hope that you will take the necessary steps to ensure that such an unfortunate incident does not happen again.

2 reviews,"Poor customer service and lack of communication from head office.

I wasn't informed in person that an item I bought was in a final sale and couldn't be returned. This was also not communicated on the receipt.  I heard nothing back after submitting a complaint. Won't be shopping at SNS in the future!",,SNS London,London
Local Guide Â· 35 reviews Â· 16 photos,"Its very unfortunate that im having to write this review, however attention needs to be given to the issue.
I bought 2 items prior to christmas for a very good price, however upon arrival decided they werent to my taste and returned both on 30/12/23.
After over 2 weeks had passed with no communication I decided to reach out to see when I was to receive my refund.
An agent has since replied stating they didnt know and that Id be passed to the returns team (this has not happened).
Today however I have received a reply stating, our returns department has reported a discrepancy on the returned order. As per their findings, the order was partially received, indicating a missing item according to our warehouse records. - which factually is not the case unless their currier who I had to pay to get returned to them has tampered with. Furthermore, even if this is the case you need to do an internal investigation and refund me my order, as your inadequate processes should not play any role in my returns procedure.
I planned to leave a review once the process had concluded, however I am so disappointed in the progress to this point, with the lack of communication and refund they should have processed a week ago, that I simply had to make it now.

***Update: SNS have replied stating it is under investigation yeah thats great but the issue has occurred once the items was with your 3rd party or actually in house at SNS.
There is absolutely no reason given as to why my funds are still being held, nor any form of urgency to solve the matter.
They should be apologising and releasing my funds, instead I get generic replies whilst they continue to break the terms of service we both agreed to .
Terrible company who dont care about their customers, AVOID buying from here, have never known a company this bad.

***Update no.2: I did not think I would need to come back to this again, but here we are.
Due to the above I contacted my bank to attempt to re-claim the payment until which time SNS honour their agreement with me, and refund me for my purchase, which appeared to work, as I received a noreply email stating the refund has been handled and I would receive the full amount of Â£131, the story should now be over. however, instead I wake up this morning with a refund from SNS for Â£66, which isn't even the exact cost of either item received.
The level of incompetency the company operates on is frightening
I have once again had to contact their customer service team, where Im sure they will be investigating the payment for the next few weeks with no action action.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, do yourselves a favour and no not shop here!

***Update no.3: After 5 long weeks, SNS have now emailed me stating, After an extensive scan of our warehouse facility, our team, unfortunately, could not locate the remaining item from your return. This indicates that the item wasn't shipped originally. Regrettably, due to this circumstance, we are unable to proceed with the refund for the remaining item.
The level of anger I have with this is off the scale. I have never dealt with a company who have lost an item, and then blamed the customer in order to not refund them. Im out of pocket Â£65 due to SNS incompetence, and theyre essentially stealing from me at this point. I will again look to raise this with my bank, but my goodness, do not shop here.",,SNS London,London

After only 7 days the New Balace 550 broke. They replaced them for me by stating that it was the same model, the same size, the same colour. In good faith I don't try them and I'm leaving. Only later do I realise that they were a smaller size. I went back to the office but the manager refused to change them stating that the code was the same and consequently also the number.

12 reviews Â· 25 photos,"Dear Size Customer Service,

I hope this message finds you in good health. I am writing to express my disappointment with my recent visit to your Carnaby Street store.

As a devoted customer of your brand, I have always admired the quality of your products. Recently, I visited your Carnaby Street location with the intention of finding a new pair of running shoes, following the advice of my physiotherapist to address a knee problem.

While I was able to obtain the size I needed, I was disheartened to find out that I was not allowed to try on both the left and right shoes simultaneously. This left me puzzled and frustrated, especially considering the importance of assessing the fit for running shoes. Also the customer next to me can do it.

Despite my offer to leave my personal belongings,  my request was denied. This strict adherence to policy, even in light of my genuine efforts to ensure the safety of your merchandise, left me feeling unfairly treated.

I want to emphasize that I made a considerable effort to visit your store in person, underscoring my belief in the quality of your products. However, this regrettable experience led me to ultimately make my purchase from a neighboring establishment.

I sincerely hope that this feedback can be used as an opportunity for improvement. I hold your brand in high regard and trust that future interactions with your store will be more positive.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.",,size?,London

As a student who works a part-time job I have never been so bothered by it because theyre being paid to do a job and they stood at the tills and looked like they hated it. My boyfriend asked a question and the girl didnt say a word she just continued scanning. I had the urge to pull her up on it but refrained from causing tension as she may have just been having a bad day but after observing other staff interact as well it was very clear the vibe was just moody and distasteful.

Still awaiting confirmation on an online order that was placed on Febuary 7th. Have called and just been told to wait it out and my money will be refunded eventually if the shoes aren't in stock and that they've inquired about it. #1 That is not service. That's no help and I would have ordered that morning off of a different site if I knew it wouldn't actually be available. Even though it was still available to purchase.

Which it definitely shouldn't have than. #2 called another store and they basically said the same thing and were a little more sympathetic but still had no answers.

#3 This companies 1-833 help line number is not even a real number you can dial. A little fishy if you ask me, regardless if shoes or money do eventually come in. I will never use this terrible companies site again. Nor should any real shoe collector . Or even anyone that just wants the shoes they ordered.  Horrific business.",,size?,London

I went back to the store a couple of days later to return them but was declined a refund. The shoes were in the same condition I bought them, my receipt stated the shoes were refundable yet the staff couldnt provide me with a valid reason not to accept the return and redirected me to size customer service who dont even deal with these type of enquiries so the staff was incredibly rude and just wanted to shrug me off as a problem. I then contacted size customer on twitter to get my problem resolved however again the service here was awful. I had to explain the problem nearly 5 times just because I kept getting a new person to solve my claim. In the end, I was redirected by the customer service back to the store and was told that the store will email me regarding my query which hasnt happened over the past 3 days. I am never shopping with size again yet being a avid shopper here for the past 3 years. I experienced awful customer service from both the staff in store and online and felt that rather than solving my problem, it was a case of my problem being redirected back and forth between twitter and size carnaby store, hoping that my receipt eventually becomes invalid and they can get rid of my problem.

Once they took out the original shoes out of the box they said they could not take them as they had signs of usage (which I agree they did btw). Once I told them they must have been returns that were sold to me as I had worn them only to try them out, they implied I was lying, which felt really rude and unnecessary. Why would I wear outside shoes that are clearly too small for me only to then try to exchange them? They literally hurt my feet for the 60 seconds I wore them. I left because I felt quite embarrassed and did not want to cause a scene in a packed store, I now find myself with apparently unreturnable shoes that I cant even wear, and frankly the worst part was being treated like a liar/scammer by the staff in a store full of people.
